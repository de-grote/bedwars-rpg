How to run:

Currently, there is no build to just run the game, one will come later.

To run the game, download the source code, you need main.py, stages.py and the assets folder at minimum to run.

Make sure you have a python interpreter installed of version 3.10+,

You also need to install pygame by running ``pip install pygame`` into the command line.

If you already have it installed make sure its version 2.0.2+ using ``pip show pygame``,

It may work for pygame 2.0.0+ but no guarantees.

Then lastly you can open main.py using the python interpreter and it'll work!
