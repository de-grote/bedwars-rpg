# Bedwars RPG

---

This game is currently in development, don't have high expectations for individual builds.

Currently, the game includes:

* (mostly) working collision
* working sneaking, running, and walking
* a (not so nice) scrolling camara
* placeable blocks

Things that will be added soon:

* better camara scrolling
* limitations to where you can place blocks (not in the player, next to other blocks, etc)
* more and better assets (that aren't stolen)
* customisable controls

Things that will be added later:

* story
* npcs and dialog
* combat (thinking about turn based but haven't made up my mind)
* inventory
* more customisation

---

Controls:

* A and D to move left and right
* SPACE to jump
* CTRL to sprint
* L-SHIFT to sneak
* any click to place block

---

Known bugs:

* placing a block near the edge of the screen and in the player freezes the game

How to run:

Currently, there is no build to just run the game, one will come later.

To run the game, download the source code, you need main.py and the assets folder at minimum to run.

Make sure you have a python interpreter installed of version 3.10+,

You also need to install pygame by running ``pip install pygame`` into the command line.

If you already have it installed make sure its version 2.0.2+ using ``pip show pygame``,

It may work for pygame 2.0.0+ but no guarantees.

Then lastly you can open main.py using the python interpreter and it'll work!
