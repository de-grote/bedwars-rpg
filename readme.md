### Known bugs:

* None

---

### How to run:

Currently, there is no build to just run the game, one will come later.

To run the game, first download the source code.

Make sure you have a python interpreter installed of version 3.10+,

You also need to install pygame by running ``pip install pygame`` into the command line.

If you already have it installed make sure its version 2.0.2+ using ``pip show pygame``,

It may work for pygame 2.0.0+ but no guarantees.

Then lastly you can open main.py using the python interpreter and it'll work!
